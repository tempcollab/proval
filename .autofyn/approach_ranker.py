"""MCP server: persistent Elo ranking over per-problem proof-approach artifacts.

Parallel expert iteration needs a *selection* layer over the population of rival
approaches a problem accumulates across rounds. The approach commentaries stay
free-form markdown (the outliner seeds each, the builder updates it —
`results/<id>/approaches/<slug>.md`); this server owns ONLY the structured ranking
metadata for those approaches, in a sidecar `results/<id>/approaches/.ranking.json`.
Subagents never hand-edit the metadata — they go through these tools, so the fields
the sampler sorts on can't drift or be corrupted at 50+ approaches over a long run.

Five tools:
  - sample_approaches  (math-explorer, proof-outliner) — P-UCB over metadata,
    returns a small candidate set so the caller reads only k bodies, not all of
    them. The explorer samples to report the terrain; the outliner samples to
    assemble the candidate field. Neither ranks — the outline-reviewer does.
  - register_approach  (outline-reviewer) — the gate: seed an approved new angle
    at the cold-start Elo; a rejected angle is never registered.
  - copy_approach      (outline-reviewer) — the gate for pursuing two paths from
    ONE approach: duplicate an existing approach under a new slug as an IDENTICAL
    TWIN — same Elo, same expanded/selected counts, same standing. The two start
    perfectly equal (both carry the same proven prefix) and diverge only through
    real signal: whichever path the builder actually advances earns the better
    outcome and rises in the ranking; the tool puts no thumb on the scale.
  - record_outcome     (proof-reviewer) — record what happened to each approach
    built this round: bumps `expanded`, writes the outcome+note, sets `stale=true`.
  - update_ranking     (outline-reviewer) — fold the round's pairwise comparisons
    over the candidate field into Elo and clear `stale`. Ranking sits here because
    the outline-reviewer sees the whole field side by side, pre-build, where the
    comparison has signal; it also picks up the `stale` outcomes the proof-reviewer
    recorded last round.

Elo: 1500 start, K=32, soft floor — a dead-ended approach loses rating and, with
a high `expanded` count, is naturally de-prioritised by P-UCB; it is never hard
-retired, so a good-but-unlucky angle can revive if its siblings die off.
